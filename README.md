### Summary

The project will be a website where users (only people with and xxxx@xxxx.edu mail) can create an user and sell items (usally second handed) to other users. The user can post photographies, a description of the item he's selling, price, where he's located, number of stock, and any delivery related information. When someone "buy" the item, the basic information of the seller is sent: email and phone number. The post of the item who was bought is hidden and no other user can buy it (if it was the last in stock). So, out of the application the users need to talk with each to finish the deal. After the item is "bought", users can grade each other with a positive, negative or neutral grade about the selling process. 

### Functionalities

- Creater a user with basic information.
- Log in into the website.
- View and edit your own profile.
- Search for items to buy.
- See another user grades.
- Create and edit posts with items that you are selling.
- Receive the information of the seller after you buy an item (can be in the website or by email).
- Grade another user after you buy an item from him.

### Technologies

Java, JavaScript, MySQL/MongoDB, AngularJS, RESTful? Spring Framework.

Reason is familiarity. Scalability will be taken into consideration with the progress of study.
